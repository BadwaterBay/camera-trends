## Our motivations

We'd like to practice our skills in Python data scraping and D3.js data visualization. We are both photography enthusiasts. We are interested in which camera brand will lead the market in the future.

## Our question

Out of three major camera brands, Canon, Nikon, and Sony, which one
will dominate the mirrorless market?

## Methodology

We scrape Google trend indices from 2004 to 2020 as a function of time and countries and correlate them with annual revenues. We use D3.js to visualize the data. We then predict future trends with machine learning.

## Results and discussion

Our final product is shown [here](https://badwaterbay.com/app/camera-trends/).
